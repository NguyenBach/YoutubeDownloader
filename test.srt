1
00:00:00,163 --> 00:00:01,606
HR jargon makes me crazy.

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,635
We have to have all these stupid acronyms

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:07,624
that describe things that nobody understands: OKRs and PIPs.

4
00:00:07,648 --> 00:00:09,283
I think we can run our businesses

5
00:00:09,307 --> 00:00:11,997
by just talking to each other like regular human beings.

6
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:13,464
We might actually get more done.

7
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:16,272
[The Way We Work]

8
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:20,375
I really always wanted to be an HR professional,

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,142
I wanted to be able to speak the language of management.

10
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,579
And you know what I've learned after all this time?

11
00:00:25,603 --> 00:00:27,134
I don't think any of it matters.

12
00:00:27,158 --> 00:00:30,132
There's all kinds of things that we call "best practices"

13
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:32,054
that aren't best practices at all.

14
00:00:32,078 --> 00:00:34,830
How do we know it's best? We don't measure this stuff.

15
00:00:34,854 --> 00:00:38,237
In fact, I've learned that "best practices" usually means

16
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:39,855
copying what everybody else does.

17
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:42,751
Our world is changing and evolving all the time.

18
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:44,918
Here are some lessons to help you adapt.

19
00:00:44,942 --> 00:00:47,489
Lesson one: Your employees are adults.

20
00:00:47,513 --> 00:00:49,624
You know, we've created so many layers

21
00:00:49,648 --> 00:00:52,442
and so many processes and so many guidelines

22
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:54,345
to keep those employees in place

23
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:58,049
that we've ended up with systems that treat people like they're children.

24
00:00:58,073 --> 00:00:59,275
And they're not.

25
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:01,846
Fully formed adults walk in the door every single day.

26
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,426
They have rent payments, they have obligations,

27
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,799
they're members of society,

28
00:01:05,823 --> 00:01:07,989
they want to create a difference in the world.

29
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:09,696
So if we start with the assumption

30
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,068
that everybody comes to work to do an amazing job,

31
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:13,679
you'd be surprised what you get.

32
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:17,151
Lesson two: The job of management isn't to control people,

33
00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:18,532
it's to build great teams.

34
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:22,127
When managers build great teams, here's how you know it.

35
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:23,468
They've done amazing stuff.

36
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:24,965
Customers are really happy.

37
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:27,275
Those are the metrics that really matter.

38
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,886
Not the metrics of: "Do you come to work on time?"

39
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,608
"Did you take your vacation?" "Did you follow the rules?"

40
00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:34,044
"Did you ask for permission?"

41
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:37,274
Lesson three: People want to do work that means something.

42
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:39,756
After they do it, they should be free to move on.

43
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,055
Careers are journeys.

44
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:43,820
Nobody's going to want to do the same thing for 60 years.

45
00:01:43,844 --> 00:01:47,097
So the idea of keeping people for the sake of keeping them

46
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:48,630
really hurts both of us.

47
00:01:48,654 --> 00:01:53,554
Instead, what if we created companies that were great places to be from?

48
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:55,188
And everyone who leaves you

49
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:58,466
becomes an ambassador for not only your product,

50
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,521
but who you are and how you operate.

51
00:02:00,545 --> 00:02:04,354
And when you spread that kind of excitement throughout the world,

52
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:06,616
then we make all of our companies better.

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,727
Lesson four: Everyone in your company should understand the business.

54
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:13,767
Now, based on the assumption that we've got smart adults here,

55
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:17,045
the most important thing we can teach them is how our business works.

56
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,448
When I look at companies that are moving fast,

57
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,850
that are really innovative

58
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:25,306
and that are doing amazing things with agility and speed,

59
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,021
it's because they're collaborative.

60
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:31,627
The best thing that we can do is constantly teach each other what we do,

61
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:35,592
what matters to us, what we measure, what goodness looks like,

62
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:38,425
so that we can all drive towards achieving the same thing.

63
00:02:38,894 --> 00:02:43,091
Lesson five: Everyone in your company should be able to handle the truth.

64
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:46,076
You know why people say giving feedback is so hard?

65
00:02:46,412 --> 00:02:47,711
They don't practice.

66
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:49,862
Let's take the annual performance review.

67
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:52,998
What else do you do in your whole life that you're really good at

68
00:02:53,022 --> 00:02:54,719
that you only do once a year?

69
00:02:54,743 --> 00:02:56,243
Here's what I found:

70
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:59,497
humans can hear anything if it's true.

71
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:03,187
So let's rethink the word "feedback,"

72
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:07,868
and think about it as telling people the truth, the honest truth,

73
00:03:07,892 --> 00:03:10,727
about what they're doing right and what they're doing wrong,

74
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:12,482
in the moment when they're doing it.

75
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:14,283
That good thing you just did, whoo!

76
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:16,140
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

77
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:17,322
Go do that again.

78
00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:20,154
And people will do that again, today, three more times.

79
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:24,584
Lesson six: Your company needs to live out its values.

80
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:27,894
I was talking to a company not long ago, to the CEO.

81
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:31,441
He was having trouble because the company was rocky

82
00:03:31,465 --> 00:03:33,460
and things weren't getting done on time,

83
00:03:33,484 --> 00:03:35,332
and he felt like things were sloppy.

84
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:38,179
This also was a man who, I observed,

85
00:03:38,203 --> 00:03:40,989
never showed up to any meeting on time.

86
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,172
Ever.

87
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:43,926
If you're part of a leadership team,

88
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,918
the most important thing that you can do to "uphold your values" is to live them.

89
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:51,313
People can't be what they can't see.

90
00:03:51,337 --> 00:03:53,877
We say, "Yes, we're here for equality,"

91
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,427
and then we proudly pound our chest

92
00:03:56,451 --> 00:03:59,587
because we'd achieved 30 percent representation of women

93
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:00,974
on an executive team.

94
00:04:00,998 --> 00:04:03,830
Well that's not equal, that's 30 percent.

95
00:04:03,854 --> 00:04:06,789
Lesson seven: All start-up ideas are stupid.

96
00:04:07,171 --> 00:04:09,566
I spend a lot of time with start-ups,

97
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,171
and I have a lot of friends that work in larger, more established companies.

98
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:16,024
They are always pooh-poohing the companies that I work with.

99
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,453
"That is such a stupid idea."

100
00:04:17,477 --> 00:04:19,775
Well, guess what: all start-up ideas are stupid.

101
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,362
If they were reasonable, somebody else would have already been doing them.

102
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:26,519
Lesson eight: Every company needs to be excited for change.

103
00:04:26,543 --> 00:04:29,132
Beware of the smoke of nostalgia.

104
00:04:29,156 --> 00:04:32,949
If you find yourself saying, "Remember the way it used to be?"

105
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,345
I want you to shift your thinking to say,

106
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:37,267
"Think about the way it's going to be."

107
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,926
If I had a dream company,

108
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,982
I would walk in the door and I would say,

109
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:43,926
"Everything's changed, all bets are off.

110
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,208
We were running as fast as we can to the right,

111
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:47,796
and now we'll take a hard left."

112
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,297
And everybody would go "Yes!"

113
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:52,655
It's a pretty exciting world out there, and it's changing all the time.

114
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,988
The more we embrace it and get excited about it,

115
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:56,591
the more fun we're going to have.
